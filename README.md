vue-multiselect-locale-de
===============================

This is just a very thin layer over [vue-multiselect](https://github.com/monterail/vue-multiselect), providing german translation of the library.

## Installing
You'd install this as you would install vue-multiselect via `npm install vue-multiselect-locale-de`
Since this is just a layer, all child properties are forwarded to `vue-multiselect`.

## Using a different dependency version
This layer ships with `2.0-beta13` by default. If you're uncomfortable with using this version you can use [npm shrinkwrap](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap), which will do it comfortably for you.

## Assemble with webpack
This module assumes that you use Webpack, or any other module bundler that is capable of handling ES6 syntax. If you're following along the Vue.js road, your current Webpack setup will probably work sanely.
